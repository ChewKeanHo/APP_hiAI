abstract: |-
  Since Google made its Google's Gemini AI Advanced Ultra for 2
  months trial with API supports for developer, it's better not to
  waste the opportunity. With REST API readily available, it's very
  easy to to turn a dumb computer with online access into an AI
  supported device via large language model (LLM) prompt.

  This project is to make LLM AI prompt available for all the current
  computing devices via interacting with API so that one does not
  need to overly dependent on a graphical user interface alone.

  When operating in Sandbox mode, this app requires:
  (1) Network access to communicate with service providers' API.
  (2) Filesystem access for 'text2image' or 'text2video' queries
      for saving the media output files.
