# This is a line-by-line long package descripton usually append after the      #
# pitch or acting independently. You can write as long as you want as long as  #
# it complies to the following rules:                                          #
#       (1) Keep it text-form only; AND                                        #
#       (2) Max 69 characters per line (DEB, RPM, and Citation requires it);   #
#           AND                                                                #

# You should write the long description of the project repository like an      #
# abstract: introducing, specify the problem, actions, and ends with what to   #
# to exect from exploring it.                                                  #

Since Google made its Google's Gemini AI Advanced Ultra for 2
months trial with API supports for developer, it's better not to
waste the opportunity. With REST API readily available, it's very
easy to to turn a dumb computer with online access into an AI
supported device via large language model (LLM) prompt.

This project is to make LLM AI prompt available for all the current
computing devices via interacting with API so that one does not
need to overly dependent on a graphical user interface alone.

When operating in Sandbox mode, this app requires:
(1) Network access to communicate with service providers' API.
(2) Filesystem access for 'text2image' or 'text2video' queries
    for saving the media output files.
