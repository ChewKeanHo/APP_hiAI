[![hiAI](src/icons/banner_1200x330.svg)](#holloway-s-hiAI)

A local terminal polygot (POSIX Shell x PowerShell) bridging LLM AI prompt
interaction capabilities.

Turn every computer's terminal into an interactive AI prompt.




## Why It Matters

Some good business reasons why using AutomataCI:

1. **Use AI prompt straight from the terminal** - No need to visit here and
   there.
2. **Simple and straight forward** - Frankly, it's created to resolve some AI
    prompt's buggy UI.
3. **Steadily improvable** - Will continue to improve over time.




## How-tos, Documentations & Specifications
TBD
